# BERT-Based NLP Project

## Overview
This project utilizes **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The notebook provides a step-by-step implementation of BERT-based text processing, feature extraction, and classification.

## Features
- **Pre-trained BERT Model:** Uses a transformer model for NLP.
- **Text Preprocessing:** Tokenization and embedding generation.
- **Fine-tuning:** Custom training on a dataset.
- **Inference:** Making predictions on text inputs.

## Installation
To set up the environment, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install transformers torch datasets
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook bert.ipynb
   ```
3. Run the notebook cells step by step.

## Dataset
- The dataset used for training/testing is either loaded from an external source or included in the repository.
- Ensure the dataset is in the correct format before running the notebook.

## Model Details
- **Architecture:** Transformer-based BERT model.
- **Pretrained Model:** `bert-base-uncased` (or another variant used in the notebook).
- **Training:** Fine-tuned with a classification/regression task.

## Results
- The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Plots and confusion matrices may be included for better visualization.
